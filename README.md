## System Check Two Notes

### Learning Goals
* Generate a dynamic web page in response to a `GET` request.
* Persist information from a user submitted via a `POST` request.
* Implement code based on acceptance tests.

### Building a Favorites List App

Building a list keeping app with Sinatra with dynamic web pages and saves information to a file.

Our app should satisfy the following requirements:

* Visiting `GET /favorites` should display a list of our favorite things as well as a form for adding a new item to the list.
* Visiting `GET /` should redirect the user to `GET /favorites`.
* The "thing" listed must be in html list element.
* The form requires a favorite thing to be specified.
* The list of favorite things is read from the `favorites_list.csv` file which stores each item on a new line.
* The form submits to `POST /favorites` which saves the new item to the `favorites_list.csv` file.
* Submitting an empty form does not modify the `favorites_list.csv` file.

## To use this as a practice:

* Run this in your terminal: `git clone https://github.com/EliseFitz15/launcher-favorites-list.git`
* Then go into the directory `cd launcher-favorites-list`
* `bundle` then `rspec`
* Work through the test errors

##### When finished it you would like to push this to your github do the following:

* In the terminal: `git remote rm origin`
* Go to Github and set up your own repo
* Terminal: `git remote add origin <your-remote-repo-url>`
* Then add and push your own work.
  - `git add .`
  - `git commit -m "initial commit"`
  - `git push origin master`
